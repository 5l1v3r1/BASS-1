BASS
====
BASS (pronounced “bæs”) is a framework designed to automatically generate
antivirus signatures from samples belonging to previously generated malware
clusters. It is meant to reduce resource usage of ClamAV by producing more
pattern-based signatures as opposed to hash-based signatures, and to alleviate
the workload of analysts who write pattern-based signatures. The framework is
easily scalable thanks to Docker.
 
Please note that this framework is still considered in the Alpha stage and as a
result, it will have some rough edges. As this tool is open source and actively
maintained by us, we gladly welcome any feedback from the community on
improving the functionality of BASS.
